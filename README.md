# ChatGPT Skill Showcase Website

This repository contains a simple static website built by ChatGPT to demonstrate some of the agent's skills. It includes:

- `index.html`: The main landing page with sections for About, Skills, and Projects.
- `style.css`: Basic styling for the page.
- `script.js`: Minimal JavaScript that prints a message in the browser console.

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site.
